# Home_Sales

For this challenge, I will use my knowledge of SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. Then you'll use Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.

I used Google Colab to run my Homes_Sales.ipynb file.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank the following people for their support and contributions to this project:

Susan Thao and Mee Thao for helping provide their coding knowledge throughout this project with me in order to complete and make sure we are partitioning the data and aching and uncaching the data properly.
